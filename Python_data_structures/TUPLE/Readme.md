# Tuple Data Structure

## Introduction

A **tuple** is an immutable, ordered collection in Python. It is often used to group related data and provides certain advantages such as faster processing and data protection due to its immutability.

## Properties of a Tuple

1. **Immutable**:  
   Once a tuple is created, its elements **cannot be changed**. This ensures data integrity.

2. **Ordered**:  
   The elements in a tuple are stored in a specific order, and each element is associated with an **index value**.

3. **Heterogeneous**:  
   Tuples can store elements of different data types, including `int`, `str`, `list`, `dict`, and more.

4. **Iterable**:  
   The elements of a tuple can be accessed sequentially using **loops** or other iterable-based operations.

## Methods in Tuples

### 1. **`count()`**
   - Returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple.
   

### 2. **`index()`**
   - Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element.

## Tuple Packing and Unpacking

### **Tuple Packing**:
   - Packing refers to creating a tuple by assigning multiple values to a single variable.

### **Tuple Unpacking**:
   - Unpacking refers to extracting the elements of a tuple into individual variables.

## Summary

The **tuple** data structure in Python is immutable and ordered, making it a reliable choice for storing data that should not be modified. With methods like `count` and `index`, as well as concepts like tuple packing and unpacking, tuples offer both simplicity and efficiency.
