# Set Data Structure

## Introduction

A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable and highly optimized for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

## Properties of a Set

1. **Unordered**:  
   The elements in a set do not have a fixed order, and indexing is not allowed.

2. **Unique Elements**:  
   A set automatically removes duplicate values, ensuring all elements are unique.

3. **Mutable**:  
   Sets can be modified after their creation by adding or removing elements.

4. **Iterable**:  
   A set can be traversed using loops or other iterable-based operations.

## Methods in Sets

### Commonly Used Methods

1. **`add()`**
   Adds an element to the set.
2. **`clear()`**
   Removes all elements from the set.
3. **`copy()`**
   Returns a shallow copy of the set.
4. **`difference()`**
   Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets.
5. **`discard()`**
    Removes an element if it is a member. Does not raise an error if the element is not found.
6. **`intersection()`**
    Returns a set with elements common to both sets.
7. **`intersection_update()`**
    Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another.
8. **`isdisjoint()`**
    Checks if two sets have no elements in common.
9. **`issubset()`**
    Checks if the set is a subset of another set.
10. **`issuperset()`**
    Checks if the set is a superset of another set.
11. **`pop()`**
    Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
12. **`remove()`**
    Removes a specific element from the set. Raises an error if the element is not found.
13. **`symmetric_difference()`**
    Returns a set with elements in either set but not in both.
14. **`symmetric_difference_update()`**
    Updates the set with the symmetric difference of itself and another.
15. **`union()`**
    Returns a set containing all unique elements from both sets.
16. **`update()`**
    Updates the set with elements from another set.


## Set Comprehension
Set comprehension allows the creation of sets in a concise and readable way, similar to list comprehensions but with unique elements.
